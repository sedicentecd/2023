## Building Azure Infrastructure with PowerShell Azure Functions called from inside a Azure SQL DB

The resources for this session are all available in this git repo:
- [psconf23-azuresql Git repo](https://github.com/jpomfret/psconf23-azuresql)

There is a devcontainer included, so you can clone that repo, open it in VSCode and then 'reopen in container' to get everything you need to develop functions locally.

Thanks for coming to the session!
