# Meanwhile, in an alternate dimension...

A look at a presence that might have been and a glimpse into possible futures of PowerShell.
Over the last few years I've spent a good deal of time combing through the PowerShell codebase
to identify areas of "immediate improvement" related to the language and type system,
and in this session we will focus on features and behaviors that _could_ be implemented in an afternoon
but have never made it into the language for one reason or the other.

Rather than talk _about_ these features, we'll go one step further an actually implement them as experimental features,
giving us a chance to explore, hands-on, "the shell that might have been (and still might be!)".

Functionality and features of interest:
- Immutable classes
- Recursive generic types
- Init-only properties
- Optional method parameters
- .NET method splatting (**kwargs for methods)
- DateTime literals
- Tuple deconstruction
- Member deconstruction
- Native Proxy Command syntax
