# Build an API with PowerShell & Azure Functions

Ben READER

Most people who work with Azure Functions tend to build small tools that do small repeatable tasks.
In this session, we are going to take it a step further and build a single Azure function that can interact
with an Azure table as an example of building "Azure functions as APIs."

We will build the entire solution from scratch and focus on authentication, code design,
request interrogation, and hopefully learn a thing or two about how PowerShell makes API development fun AND easy!
